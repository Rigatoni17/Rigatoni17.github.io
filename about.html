										<h2 id="content">Why?</h2>
										<p>This is a fundamental question that I don't know if I will ever be able to answer. I feel like my reasons for doing something initially, changes over time as I look back on it. When I thought about creating a website, I didn't see it as worthwhile and just assumed it was easy. It's not like we're implementing supercomplicated algorithms for this personal website. However, it still took me a decent enough time and taught me that I have a ways to go still. Hopefully, the features I'm thinking of implementing right now will look like a peace of cake to me in the future. I used Forty by HTML5 UP as my starting template for design.</p>
										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>Current</h3>
												<p>Honestly, I don't have too much freetime right now and I think passion has driven me pretty far to get this website up. Balancing between work, classes, and clubs I waiting until break to revisit this site.</p>

											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>Future</h3>
												<p>I need to add links to most of the buttons. I want to implement Dark/Light mode. I initially set out for this in the beginning, but decided to hold off on it until I get a good color scheme for light mode. I also want to revamp the interests page by having galleries, more animations, and expanding upon my interest. I also want to include a photo of myself, but becuase of small storage on my devices, I will have to wait till I get home to get those. I think the home page could have one more element but I haven't decided on what I wanted.</p>
